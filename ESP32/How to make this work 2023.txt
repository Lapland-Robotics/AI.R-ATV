You have to make following changes in Arduino IDE to make code work:
1.Board: BoardManager: "esp32" version 1.0.6 then use Board "ESP32 Dev Module"
      Otherwise you get an error along the lines of "mismatched rosserial version error 
      e.g. having rosserial melodic and ros noetic"
2.in library manager, use ESP32TimerInterrupt version 1.5.0
3.in library manager, use ROSserial version 0.9.1
4.Go here https://github.com/enwaytech/ros_lib_arduino/tree/master 
,download ZIP, and then move ackermann_msgs folder from src folder
to "C:\ArduinoIDE\libraries\Rosserial_Arduino_Library\src" 
or wherever your Arduino IDE library folder is located
5.Bob is your uncle
6.This is not yet tested with fresh setup, make sure to check other guides in
case of trouble.
