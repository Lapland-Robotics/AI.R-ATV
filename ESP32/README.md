# Arduino sketch for ATV Interface (ESP32)
## Install Arduino IDE
You can use _Ubuntu Sofware_ -application for installing Arduino IDE
or follow:

## Install ros_lib into the Arduino Environment
[http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup)

The preceding installation steps created the necessary libraries, now the following will create the ros_lib folder that the Arduino build environment needs to enable Arduino programs to interact with ROS.
In the steps below, <sketchbook> is the directory where the Linux Arduino environment saves your sketches. Typically this is a directory called sketchbook or Arduino in your home directory. e.g cd ~/Arduino/libraries
Ros_lib installation instructions are different for groovy source (catkin) than for earlier (rosbuild) or binary releases. Be sure you've selected the correct build system - catkin for a groovy source build, rosbuild otherwise.
Note: you have to delete libraries/ros_lib, if present, in order to regenerate as its existence causes an error. "rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py" creates the ros_lib directory.
```
$ cd <sketchbook>/libraries
$ rm -rf ros_lib
$ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ros_lib
```
*Note: Currently you can install the Arduino libaries directly in the Arduino IDE. Just open the Library Manager from the IDE menu in Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Library. Then search for "rosserial". This is useful if you need to work on an Arduino sketch but don't want to setup a full ROS workstation.

  
## General Notes when using ESP32 and rosserial in ESP32
  
## ESP32 HW Timer
```
#include "ESP32TimerInterrupt.h"
``` 
  
## ESP32 rebooting when Arduino IDE ROS libraries used:

HOW TO AVOID THIS:
Thank you LorenzF in [https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/4807](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/4807)

On Arduino Ros library ros_lib there is ros.h .

Replace or comment this:
```
#if defined(ESP8266) or defined(ESP32) or defined(ROSSERIAL_ARDUINO_TCP)
  #include "ArduinoTcpHardware.h"
#else
  #include "ArduinoHardware.h"
#endif
```
with this:
```
#if defined(ROSSERIAL_ARDUINO_TCP)
  #include "ArduinoTcpHardware.h"
#else
  #include "ArduinoHardware.h"
#endif
```

## CHANGE ROSSERIAL BAUD RATE
You have to change parameters in ArduinoHardware.h in ros_lib.

## Jetson Nano UART: (THIS WONT WORK, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME)
Before You Start
(Copied from some where nVidia Developer Forum) The stock Jetson Nano starts a console on the ttyTHS1 serial port at startup through a service. The script that starts the service is nvgetty.sh which launches getty. The script is located in /etc/systemd. While this does not conflict with the script presented here, consider disabling the console if you are using the serial port to avoid conflicts. Note that normal udev rules will be overridden by the console while the service is running. To disable the console:
```
$ systemctl stop nvgetty
$ systemctl disable nvgetty
$ udevadm trigger
# You may want to reboot instead
```
